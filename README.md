# Netacad-Ethical-Hacker-Capstone-Project
Cisco NetAcad Ethical Hacker Capstone ProjectProject 
Overview: This repository documents the final capstone engagement for the Cisco Networking Academy: Ethical Hacker course. The objective of this project was to conduct a comprehensive security assessment of a localized enterprise network (10.5.5.0/24) to identify vulnerabilities, demonstrate potential exploits, and provide actionable remediation strategies.Target EnvironmentTarget Subnet: 10.5.5.0/24
Operating Systems: Mixed environment including Windows Server, Linux (Ubuntu/Debian), and legacy Windows workstations.
Tools: Wireshark, Metasploit, DVWA, tcpdump, nmap, John the Ripper, Hydra, SQLmap.
Network Security: Standard firewall configurations with internal routing.MethodologyThis engagement followed the standard Cyber Kill Chain and NIST SP 800-115 technical assessment guidelines:1. Reconnaissance & EnumerationPerformed active and passive scanning to map the live hosts within the 10.5.5.0/24 range.Network Mapping: Used nmap -sP 10.5.5.0/24 to identify active assets.Service Discovery: Detailed version scanning (-sV) and OS fingerprinting (-O) on identified targets.Tools: Nmap, Zenmap, Netdiscover.2. Vulnerability AssessmentAnalyzed identified services for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) and misconfigurations.Automated Scanning: Utilized OpenVAS/Nessus for broad vulnerability detection.Manual Analysis: Investigated web headers, SMB shares (Null sessions), and outdated SSH versions.3. ExploitationDemonstrated the impact of identified vulnerabilities through controlled exploitation.Web Attack: SQL Injection on 10.5.5.25 to bypass authentication.Service Exploit: Exploiting a vulnerable SMB service on 10.5.5.10 using Metasploit.Credential Auditing: Brute-force testing on SSH using Hydra to identify weak administrative passwords.4. Post-Exploitation & Lateral MovementPrivilege Escalation: Exploiting local misconfigurations (SUID bits) to gain root access.Persistence: Demonstrating how an attacker might maintain access via cron jobs or registry keys.
Remediation Recommendations
Patch Management: Update all Windows hosts to mitigate SMB vulnerabilities.
Input Validation: Sanitize all database queries on the web server at 10.5.5.25.Password Policy: 
Implement a strong MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) policy for all SSH/RDP access.
Network Segmentation: Isolate the $10.5.5.0/24$ subnet from critical data zones using a VLAN.DisclaimerNote: 
This project was conducted within a strictly controlled, authorized educational environment. All tools and techniques were applied against assets owned by the lab environment. Unauthorized access to computer systems is illegal and unethical.
